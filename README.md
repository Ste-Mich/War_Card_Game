# War_Card_Game
a War card game made in Python

If you do not know the game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)

Since you can only make one move, I decided to make it all automated.
This essentially makes it a glorified coin flip simulator.

The game runs a deck of 54 cards in the background implemented using classes.
